scenery of nature, and which, as far as the incidents
of rural life admit, may interest by an agreeable fable,
and delight by a judicious alternatim ol narrative and
dialogue. .

Longus has also avoided many of the faults into
which his modern imitatore have hilen, and which
have brought this style ol composition into so much
disrepute5 his characters ,never express the con·

characteristic traits of ruml life are erased,but attempts
to please by a genuine imitation of Nature, and by
descriptions of the manners, the rustic occupations,
