HISTORY OF FlCTlON..

noos-¹

We now proceed to the analysis of a romanoe diffe-
· rent in its nature from the works already mentioned3
and ola species which may be distinguished hythe
,appellation of Pastoral romance.

lt may be conjectured with much probability, that

pastoral composition sometimes expressed the devo· '

' tion, and sometimes formed the entertainment ol'the
first generations of mankind. The sacred writings suf·
liciently inform us that it existed among the eastern
nations during the earliest ages. Rural images are every
< where scattercd through the Old Testament3 and the
Song of Solomon in particular beautifully delineates
the charms ofa country life, while it paints the most
amiahle affections of the mind, and the sweetest sce·
nery of nature. Α number of passages ol' Theocritus
bear a striking resemblance to descriptions in the
inspired pastoral3 and many critics have believed that
he has studied its beauties and transferred them to his
eclogues. Theocritus was imitated in his ownhdialect
by Moschus and Bion; and virgil, taking advantage
of a different language, copied yet rivalled the Siciliam.
