pass the night in festivity, but at dawn of day they
are terrified by the unloolred-for appearance of Pan,

who threatens them with being drowned before they
arrive at their intended place of destination, unless
they set Chloe at liberty. Through this respectable
interposition, Chloe is allowed to return home, and
is speedily restored to the arnas of Daphnis. -The
grateful lovers sing hymns to the nymphs. On the fol·
lowing day they sacrifice to Pan, and harig a goat’s
skin on a pine adjoining his image. The feast which
follows this ceremony is attended by all the old she-
pherds in the neighbourhood, who recount the 'adven-
tures of their youth, and their children danee to the
sound of the pipe.

The third book commences with the approach of
winter, and from the description of that season which
is given in the romance, it would appear that at the
period of its composition the temperature of the Les-

, bian climate was colder than itis now represented by

travellers. We are told in the pastoral, that early in
wihter a sudden fall of snow shuts up all the roads,

the peasants are confined to their cottages, and the ’

earth nowhere appears except on the brinlrs of rivers,
or sides of fountains. No one leads forth his floclts to
, pasture3 hut by a blazing fire some twist cords for the
net, sorite plait goat’s hair, and others malie suares for
the birds, the hogs are fed with acorns in the' sty‚ the
sheep with leaves in the folds, and the oxen with chaff
in'the stalls.
