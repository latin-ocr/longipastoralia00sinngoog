dramatic pastoral. This opinion is combated by Vil-
loison, on the, greum that the first edition ol Len·
gus was not publisbed till 1598, audehat 'fasso died
in the year 1595. lt is true thau the first Greek edition
of Longus vvas notpublishedtill1598,but there was
a Freueh translation by Amyot, which appeared in
1559, and one in Latin verse by caream in 1569,
either of which might have been seen by Tasso. But
although this argument brought forwerd by Villoison
be of little avail, heis probably right in the general
'notion he has adopted, that Daphnis and Chloe was
not the origin of the pastoral drama. The Sacrfieio of
Agostino Reecari, whiehwas the earliest specimen of
this style of composition, and was acted at Ferrara in
1554, was writoen previous to the appearance of any
edition or version of longus. Nor is there any simi-
larity in the storyor incidents of the Aminta to those
in Daphnis and Chloe, which should lead usto ima·
gine that the Greek romance had been imitated by,
Tasso. · .

brought up as shepberds by reputed fathers, are dis-

covered by their real parents by means of tokens laste ῃ
ned to them when they were abandoned. There is also .

a considerable resemblance between the story of Da-

phnis and Chloe aud that ol the Gentle Shepherd :the
plot was suggested to Rannay by one of his friends,
