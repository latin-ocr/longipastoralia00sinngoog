Daphnis having one day fallen into a covered pit
which was dug for the wolf, and being considerahly
hurt, receives from Chloe a ltiss, which serves as the
first luel to the dame of love.

Chloe had another admirer, Dor00‚ the cowherd,

who having in vain requested her in marriage from
Dryas, her reputed father, resolves to carry her off
by force3 for this purpose he disguises himself asa
wolf, and lurks among some bushes near a place
where Chloe used to pastore her sheep. ln this garb he
is discovered and attached by the dogs‚ who entered
into his frolic with unexpected alacrity‚ butis preserved
from being torn to pieres by the· timely arrival of
Daphnis. From the example of Doroo this became a
favourite stratagem among pastoral characters. In the
,Pastor Fido (act. IV, sc. ll.) Dorinda disguises her·
sellas a wolf and the troubadour Vidal was hunted
down in consequence of a similar experiment.
. Spring was now at an end -- summer heamed forth
and all Nature flourished- the trees were loaded with
fruits‚ the fields were covered with corn, and the
woods were filled with melody- every thing tended
to inspice pleasure—the sweet hum of the cicada, the
fragrance of the ripening apples, and the bleatiug of
the sheep. The gliding streams were heard as if they
modulated the song, and the breeaes rustlingamong
the pines seemed the hreath-of the flute.
