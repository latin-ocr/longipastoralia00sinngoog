The season of the year precludes the interviews of
Daphnis and Chloe. They could no longer meet in the
fields, and Daphnis was afraid to excite suspicion by
visiting the object of his passion at the cottage of Dryas.
He ventures, however, to approach its vicinity, under
pretext of laying snares for birds. Engagcd in this
employment, he waits a long time without any per
son appearing from the house. At length, when about
to depart, Dryas himself comes out in pursuit of a dog
who had run off with the family dinner. He perceives
Daphnis with his gamo, and accordingly, as a profi·
table speculation, invites him into the cottage. The
birds he had caught are prepared for supper, a se·
cond cup is filled, a new lireis lindled, and Daphnis
is asked to remain next day to attend a sacrifice to be
performed to Bacchus. By accepting the invitation, he
for some time longer enjoys the society of Chloe. The
lovers part, praying for the revival of spring, but

while the winter lasted, Daphnis frequently visits
the habitation of Dryas.

When spring returns, Daphnis and Chloe are the
first to lead out their floclss to pasture. Their ardour
when thcy meet in the fields is increased by long
absence, and the season of the year, but their hearts
remain innocent, - a purity which the author still
imputes not to virtue, but to ignorance.
